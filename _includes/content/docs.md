# Documentation

We treat our docs like we treat our code. And like our code, we invite everyone to join in. Simply create an issue in GitHub and we'll review it.

If you'd like to submit content that you wrote, paste it into [Gist](http://gist.github.com) and include its link in the issueâ€™s comments. Also, be sure to tell us what information we can use to honorably mention your contribution. We like to give credit where credit is due.
