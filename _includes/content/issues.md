## Reporting Issues

Have an issue to report? These steps will walk you through the escalation process.

1. Scroll through our [issues]({{site.github.issues.open}}) on GitHub. See if yours has already been reported, resolved, deferred, or cued up for work.
2. Be sure to include relevant information, such as versions, what components or tools you use, when it was deployed, and anything else that will help diagnostically.
3. Use [Gist](http://gist.github.com) to share code snippets and pastes with us. Add the link to your Gist page in the issue's comments. (optional)
4. When you're ready, click the button below to create your issue.
